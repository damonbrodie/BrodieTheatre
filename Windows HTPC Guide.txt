I use the following guide for setting up Windows 10 for a new HTPC:

If doing a fresh install from an existing HTPC:
- Consider saving the AppData\Roaming\Kodi folder
- Save the Documents folder


During Initial Install:
- Select US, English for language and keyboard 
- Use a Local offline user account
- Do not set a password, pin or other methods to login in
- Do not enable Cortana

After Install completes:
- If previously saved, restore the Kodi and Documents folders
- Install TightVNC server.  For me I install without login or admin password
- Disable Notifications
- Install Kodi
- Install RestartOnCrash, Add Kodi
- Set the static IP
- Turn off lock screen
- Turn on file sharing without Password in Network Settings
- Set the Restart Active time to suit theatre use
- Set the Power profile
  - Max performance
  - turn off USB power savings
  - Set display to go to sleep to Never
  - Set Lid and Power buttons to disabled
  - Set to never go to sleep automatically
- Disable Screen saver
- Under Control Panel > System and Security > System:
  - Set the Computer Name and Workgroup
  - Under Advanced System Settings
    - System Failure "Automatically Restart"
	- Disable Write Debugging information (for faster restarts)
-Set graphics Adapter to 1920x1080x60hz (non-interlaced)
-Uninstall all unneeded Windows junkware


Personal Config:
- Install BrodieTheatre App, add to RestartonCrash
- Create Documents\Shared and then Enable the File Sharing for that folder
- Set desktop background to black
- Remove Recycle bin icon:  Taskbar Settings > Turn system icons on or off
- Move the Taskbar to the top of the screen and lock
